# Website built with AI 
My initial prompt was. 
Can you build me a website with theses conditions "copied from assignment"?
Can you make it about building surfboards?
Can you make it ocean themed?

I then put all of this in VS code. 
used git to push to the repo i set up on Git Hub
I attempted to play around with the CSS to try and center the page.
I had to do a roll back from the broken CSS
I ended on this final product.
